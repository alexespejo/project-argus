# Project Argus

## What is it

Argus is a facial recognition camera and smart door lock accompanied by a dedicated web application. Combining my knowledge of IOT and web development over this past semester.

## Technology overview

To build out the camera I used the Python OpenCV and face recognition libraries along side a Raspberry PI and the Raspberry PI Camera V2.

\*currently
The web application is being built using vanilla HTML but I soon hope to implement React/React Native into the final project

The camera and web app backends are built with Flask and Firebase using the Firestore as the main database

### Technologies

IOT: Raspberry PI, Raspberry PI Camera V2, Python, Flask, OpenCV

APP: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Boostrap, SCSS

BACKEND: Python, Flask, Firebase, Firestore

### Futures

Plan to fully create the app in React.js
-Implement pyTorch or TensorFlow to the face recognition system
-Bring in D3 for processing analytics to the app
